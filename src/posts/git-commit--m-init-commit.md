## A blog is born!

Hello hello!

It's taken me a long time to decide to finally write my own blog but we're finally here.

> \>\>\> Write a blog

is probably the most popular project suggestion you can find on the internet and one I've personally given to fellow software enthusiasts looking for inspiration.

When I recommend developing a blog to people asking for project ideas, I usually also recommend authoring blog posts that chronicle their own development as software engineers. That's pretty much what I'm going to be doing with this project.

The purpose of this blog is two-fold:

- Act as a retrospective into issues I've come across in my personal projects,
- Vent about work-related frustrations.

As for how the blog is developed, I'm using [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript 4.7](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) because I found it convenient at the time.

TypeScript is a first for me, for a personal project, at least. I'm thoroughly enjoying it even though it's kicking my butt. I've dabbled in the occassional, simple SPA with Facebook's [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/), mostly stayed in the shallows of web development.
